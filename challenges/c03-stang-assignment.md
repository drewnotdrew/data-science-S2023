*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes,
the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we
engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we
talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever
looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this
challenge you’ll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data
will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published
material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy
form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a
number of Aluminum plates to determine their
[elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and
[Poisson’s ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).
These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such
as aircraft skin under [buckling
loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested
plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to
the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking))
direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data
form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data
for this challenge.

``` r
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
```

    ## Rows: 9 Columns: 8
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): alloy
    ## dbl (7): thick, E_00, mu_00, E_45, mu_45, E_90, mu_90
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
df_stang
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 × 8
    ##   thick  E_00 mu_00  E_45  mu_45  E_90 mu_90 alloy  
    ##   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>

    ## 9 0.081 10000 0.311    -1 -1      9900 0.314 al_24st

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient
for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### **q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, nu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special
value for `names_to`.

``` r
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-
  df_stang %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c(".value", "angle"),
    names_sep = "_",
    cols = c("E_00":"mu_90")
  ) %>%
  filter(E > as.integer(0)) %>%
  mutate(angle = as.integer(angle))

df_stang_long
```

    ## # A tibble: 26 × 5
    ##    thick alloy   angle     E    mu
    ##    <dbl> <chr>   <int> <dbl> <dbl>
    ##  1 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.321
    ##  2 0.022 al_24st    45 10700 0.329
    ##  3 0.022 al_24st    90 10500 0.31 
    ##  4 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.323
    ##  5 0.022 al_24st    45 10500 0.331
    ##  6 0.022 al_24st    90 10700 0.323
    ##  7 0.032 al_24st     0 10400 0.329
    ##  8 0.032 al_24st    45 10400 0.318
    ##  9 0.032 al_24st    90 10300 0.322
    ## 10 0.032 al_24st     0 10300 0.319
    ## # … with 16 more rows

# EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

## Initial checks

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q2** Perform a basic EDA on the aluminum data *without visualization*. Use your analysis to answer the questions under *observations* below. In addition, add your own *specific* question that you’d like to answer about the data—you’ll answer it below in q3.

``` r
glimpse(df_stang_long)
```

    ## Rows: 26
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ thick <dbl> 0.022, 0.022, 0.022, 0.022, 0.022, 0.022, 0.032, 0.032, 0.032, 0…
    ## $ alloy <chr> "al_24st", "al_24st", "al_24st", "al_24st", "al_24st", "al_24st"…
    ## $ angle <int> 0, 45, 90, 0, 45, 90, 0, 45, 90, 0, 45, 90, 0, 45, 90, 0, 45, 90…
    ## $ E     <dbl> 10600, 10700, 10500, 10600, 10500, 10700, 10400, 10400, 10300, 1…
    ## $ mu    <dbl> 0.321, 0.329, 0.310, 0.323, 0.331, 0.323, 0.329, 0.318, 0.322, 0…

``` r
n_distinct(df_stang_long$alloy)
```

    ## [1] 1

``` r
n_distinct(df_stang_long$angle)
```

    ## [1] 3

``` r
n_distinct(df_stang_long$thick)
```

    ## [1] 4

**Observations**:

- Is there “one true value” for the material properties of Aluminum?
  - No, there is some variation. However, a cursory glance at the data
    shows that the variation could be due to natural unaccounted for
    variables.
- How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
  - The `n_distinct` function reports a value of 1 when fed the `alloy`
    column.
- What angles were tested?
  - The `n_distinct` function reports a value of 3 when fed the `angle`
    column.
- What thicknesses were tested?
  - There are four distinct thicknesses. 0.022, 0.032, 0.064, and 0.081.
- Does Poission’s ratio change with specimen thickness?

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

``` r
## TASK: Investigate your question from q1 here
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(thick, "Poission's Ratio")) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(y = mu, color = angle, size = E)) +
    ylab("Poission's Ratio") +
    xlab("Thickness")
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- The variation of Poission’s ratio is quite small, small enough where
  it could be due to environmental factors unaccounted for in this
  dataset. This makes sense - the Poission Ratio of a material should
  not change based on the geometry of the part.

### **q4** Consider the following statement:

“A material’s property (or material property) is an intensive property
of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the
amount of the material.”\[2\]

Note that the “amount of material” would vary with the thickness of a
tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim
that “elasticity `E` is an intensive material property.” Why or why not?
Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(mu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-vis-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
  - Whether or not the graph supports the claim heavily depends on
    context on elasticity of materials. The units of elasticity are not
    mentioned for this dataset, but given that they are around 10,000,
    and the elasticity of aluminum is around 10,000 ksi, we can make an
    educated guess that the units are in ksi.
  - The elasticity of steel is approximately 30,000 ksi, or roughly
    triple that of aluminum. The difference between these two is enough
    where variation smaller than 1000 ksi could be attributed to natural
    variation.
  - While the graph supports the claim that elasticity is an intensive
    property given proper context, it does not display it convincingly.
    A sense of scale is needed, perhaps a line showing the average
    elasticity of the data, and a line for the typical elasticity of
    steel.
